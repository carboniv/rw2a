PREDICATES HOLY SHIT

scoreboards
	make SURE to prefix scoreboards with
		# ! \ <> or any character that a mcplayer cannot have

other files
	function datapack:folder/function

misc
	If you are working with datapacks you can(as far as i know) put all blocks that wont kill you 
	in a group with the same tag and then test with execute if block #tagname. Similar to #wool 
	for all wool colors or #log for all log types... idk i havent worked with that so far, but i 
	know that you can do it somehow
