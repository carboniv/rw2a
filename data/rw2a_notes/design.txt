race design lite
    passive buff (1-2 effects): related to biome, block, held item, environment
    consumable: most non-rightclick minecraft items or normal consumable, should synergize with their buff's sources
    debuff (1-2 sources): some weakness that not only "balances" but encourages players to make their home in different environments
