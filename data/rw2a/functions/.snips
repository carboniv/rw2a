You can use macros in datapack to insert any value into any part of the command (1.20.2+).

For example:

# Setup
data modify storage example:macro tp.distance set value 2.5d

# function example:macro/tp
$tp @s ^ ^ ^$(distance)

# In chat
function example:macro/tp with storage example:macro tp
So, by run this command in the chat you will teleport yourself as many blocks forward as set in storage example:macro tp.distance

----

/advancement revoke @s from minecraft:recipes/root
However, I recommend you remove all recipes using /recipe take @s *
